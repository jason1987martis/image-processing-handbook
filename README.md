## Introduction

This handbook is designed to provide a clear and concise reference for various image processing techniques. Each section contains code examples and explanations to help you understand and implement these techniques in your own projects.

## Basic Operations

### Contrast Adjustment
- **Python**: [contrast_adjustment.py](basic_operations/brightness_adjustment.py)
- **Description**: Adjust the contrast of an image using different methods like histogram equalization.

### Brightness Adjustment
- **Python**: [brightness_adjustment.py](basic_operations/brightness_adjustment.py)
- **Description**: Change the brightness of an image by adding a constant value to the pixel values.

## Filters

### Gaussian Blur
- **Python**: [gaussian_blur.py](filters/gaussian_blur.py)
- **Description**: Apply a Gaussian blur to an image to reduce noise and detail.

### Median Filter
- **Python**: [median_filter.py](filters/median_filter.py)
- **Description**: Use a median filter to reduce noise in an image by replacing each pixel with the median value of its neighborhood.

## Edge Detection

### Canny Edge Detection
- **Python**: [canny_edge.py](edge_detection/cannyedge.py)
- **Description**: Detect edges in an image using the Canny edge detection algorithm.

### Sobel Edge Detection
- **Python**: [sobel_edge.py](edge_detection/sobel.py)
- **Description**: Apply the Sobel operator to find edges in an image by calculating the gradient magnitude.

## Segmentation

### Thresholding
- **Python**: [thresholding.py](segementation/thresholding.py)
- **Description**: Segment an image by converting it to a binary image based on a threshold value.

### Watershed Algorithm
- **Python**: [watershed.py](segementation/watershedding.py)
- **Description**: Use the watershed algorithm to segment an image based on the topology of its intensity values.

## Morphological Operations

### Dilation
- **Python**: [dilation.py](morphological_operations/dilation.py)
- **Description**: Apply dilation to an image to increase the size of the foreground objects.

### Erosion
- **Python**: [erosion.py](morphological_operations/erosion.py)
- **Description**: Apply erosion to an image to decrease the size of the foreground objects.

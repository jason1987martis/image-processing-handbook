# Image Processing Handbook

Welcome to the Image Processing Handbook! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of image processing techniques and code examples in Python. 
Each section includes detailed explanations and sample images to help you understand and apply these techniques.

## Libraries Used

### OpenCV
- **Description**: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, and MATLAB and is widely used for real-time computer vision applications.
  
- **Installation**: You can install OpenCV for Python using pip:
```pip install opencv-python```

### NumPy
- **Description**: NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures. NumPy is often used in image processing for manipulating image data as arrays.
  
- **Installation**: You can install NumPy using pip:
 ```pip install numpy```
   
### Matplotlib
- **Description**: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is widely used for plotting and visualizing data, including image data, which makes it a valuable tool in image processing for displaying images and their transformations.

- **Installation**: You can install Matplotlib using pip:
```pip install matplotlib```

## Introduction

This handbook is designed to provide a clear and concise reference for various image processing techniques. Each section contains code examples and explanations to help you understand and implement these techniques in your own projects.

## Basic Operations

### Contrast Adjustment
- **Python**: [contrast_adjustment.py](basic_operations/brightness_adjustment.py)
- **Description**: Adjust the contrast of an image using different methods like histogram equalization.

### Brightness Adjustment
- **Python**: [brightness_adjustment.py](basic_operations/brightness_adjustment.py)
- **Description**: Change the brightness of an image by adding a constant value to the pixel values.

### Resizing
- **Python**: [resize.py](basic_operations/resize.py)
- **Description**: Resize an image to the specified width and height.

### Grayscale Conversion
- **Python**: [grayscale.py](basic_operations/gray.py)
- **Description**: Convert a color image to a grayscale image.

### Rotating
- **Python**: [rotate.py](basic_operations/rotate/rotate.py)
- **Description**: Rotate an image by a specified angle.

### Cropping
- **Python**: [crop.py](basic_operations/crop.py)
- **Description**: Crop a specified region from an image.

### Flipping
- **Python**: [flip.py](basic_operations/flip.py)
- **Description**: Flip an image horizontally, vertically, or both.

### Translation (Shifting)
- **Python**: [translate.py](basic_operations/shifting.py)
- **Description**: Shift an image along the x and y axes.

### Histogram Equalization
- **Python**: [histogram_equalization.py](basic_operations/histogramequalize.py)
- **Description**: Improve the contrast of an image by equalizing its histogram.

### Inversion
- **Python**: [invert.py](basic_operations/inversion.py)
- **Description**: Invert the colors of an image.

## Filters

### Gaussian Blur
- **Python**: [gaussian_blur.py](filters/gaussian_blur.py)
- **Description**: Apply a Gaussian blur to an image to reduce noise and detail.

### Median Filter
- **Python**: [median_filter.py](filters/median_filter.py)
- **Description**: Use a median filter to reduce noise in an image by replacing each pixel with the median value of its neighborhood.

## Edge Detection

### Canny Edge Detection
- **Python**: [canny_edge.py](edge_detection/cannyedge.py)
- **Description**: Detect edges in an image using the Canny edge detection algorithm.

### Sobel Edge Detection
- **Python**: [sobel_edge.py](edge_detection/sobel.py)
